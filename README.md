## Ideas

+ Allow to load aribitrary scenes (Depth and DOF).
+ Use PShapes to burst performance (Depth and DOF).
+ Use the scene `pixelDepth(pixel)` method to find the focus target in DOF (requires version >= 2.0.5).
+ ~~Adapt the other [openframeworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) addons found at the [ofxPostProcessing repo](https://github.com/neilmendoza/ofxPostProcessing)
to **Processing** using **Proscene**.~~
